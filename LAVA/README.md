# LAVA 

In this study, the [LAVA](https://github.com/josefin-werme/LAVA) pipeline was used to conduct bivariate local correlations between [ADHD Demontis et al. 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01285-8), [Cortisol Crawfort et al 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s10038-020-00895-6), and  various testosterone levels, including male testosterone, female testosterone, and combined male and female testosterone levels.

For each pair of phenotypes, a bash script was executed to invoke the LAVA base R script, imputing the necessary data.
