# LAVA 

In this study, the [LAVA](https://github.com/josefin-werme/LAVA) pipeline was used to conduct bivariate comparisons between ADHD and various testosterone levels, including male testosterone, female testosterone, and combined male and female testosterone levels.

For each pair of phenotypes, a bash script was executed to invoke the LAVA base R script, imputing the necessary data.
