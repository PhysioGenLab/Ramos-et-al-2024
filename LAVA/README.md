# LAVA 

In this study, the [LAVA](https://github.com/josefin-werme/LAVA) pipeline was used to conduct bivariate local correlations between [ADHD Demontis et al. 2023]( 10.1038/s41588-022-01285-8) and various testosterone levels, including male testosterone, female testosterone, and combined male and female testosterone levels.

For each pair of phenotypes, a bash script was executed to invoke the LAVA base R script, imputing the necessary data.
